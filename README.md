# IOS_Paper_CricketGame
A simple paper cricket game using Swift UI.
As we spent our school life at Monipur High School, Dhaka, Bangladesh; we played a simple paper game at that golden days. The game idea is, we drawed a circle and sloted different areas for different Runs & some slots for Out. One player closed his eyes and other one spined the paper. The player who closed his eyes, randomly moved his pen to any slots for Run/out. 

So, here we tired to implement that idea in this simple game. 25 Balls with 10 wickets.

This game has some limitations. For the first time we need to press the BAT Button and after 25 balls, we need to press BALL Button. After that Winner will be announced between two Teams. However, we will update and add more functionality later. Enjoy!
